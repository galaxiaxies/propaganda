    <b>Speaker</b><br>
    Greece’s government, mainly the military sector.<br>
    <b>Occasion</b><br>
    Greece had just entered WWI, mainly with intention to take Istanbul from the Ottomans.<br>
    <b>Audience</b><br>
    Greek citizens, primarily those who have money and have not purchased t-bills.<br>
    <b>Purpose</b><br>
    To encourage Greek citizens to purchase t-bills.<br>
    <b> Subject</b><br>
    T-bills.<br>
    <b><u>Strategies</u></b><br>
    <b>Symbolism</b><br>
    The two-headed eagle is a symbol of power and majesty, and has been used by many countries to represent such. In
    this case, the eagle is representative of Greece.<br>
    The Ottoman empire is symbolized by their flag. It is being grabbed by the eagle, representing how Greece wants to
    seize Istanbul and several other cities from the Ottomans.<br>
    <b>Exaggeration</b><br>
    The eagle in the foreground is larger than Istanbul in the back. This implies the eagle is massive, and will likely
    take Istanbul easily.<br>
    <b>Generalization/Ad hominem</b><br>
    Representing the Ottomans as a non-living object dehumanizes the Ottomans. It also subtly implies that the Ottomans
    will be defeated easily.<br>
    <b>Appeal to religion/authority</b><br>
    The double headed eagle is a well known symbol of the Orthodox Church, including the Greek Orthodox Church. This
    shows some of the Greek’s motives for wanting Istanbul, as Istanbul has been historically fought over by Christians
    and Muslims.
