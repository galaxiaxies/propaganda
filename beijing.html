        PHẢI!<br>

        HAY CHỐNG BỌN<br>
        TAY SAI CỦA BẮC-KINH<br>
        <br>
        ENDURE!<br>
        MAKE A HABIT OF BEING AGAINST<br>
        THE HENCHMEN OF THE TERRIFYING NORTH [Beijing, China]<br>
    </h3>

    <b>Speaker</b><br>
    South Vietnam (cannot find exact source). Specifically, those in South Vietnam that are against China.<br>
    <b>Occasion</b><br>
    In the 1950s (Vietnam War era), Vietnam and China had a very poor relationship. As well, Vietnam was about to split
    into North and South Vietnam. Communist China was aiding North Vietnam with military pursuits.<br>
    <b>Audience</b><br>
    Those in South Vietnam, especially those who are neutral or on the fence in opposing China.<br>
    <b>Purpose</b><br>
    To unite Vietnamese people against the Chinese, or push them to a decision.<br>
    <b>Subject</b><br>
    Portraying China in a negative light.<br>
    <b><u>Strategies</u></b><br>
    <b>Inclusive language</b><br>
    Bright colors bring attention to the reader’s involvement in resistance to China (“chính bạn” means “yourself”)<br>
    The man pointing to the reader provides even more reader involvement.<br>
    <b>Allusion</b><br>
    While perhaps not intentional, the man on the poster very much resembles the famous WWI poster, “What Are You Doing
    for Preparedness?” (“I Want You”). The man is also very Westernized in art style.<br>
    <b>Loaded terms</b><br>
    “Bắc-kinh” meaning “terrifying north”, as well as “tay sai” [henchmen], demonizes China, despite what China has or
    hasn’t done.
