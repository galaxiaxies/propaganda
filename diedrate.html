    <b>Speaker</b><br>
    Me, or anyone who has had to deal with people not bringing their water to practice.<br>
    <b>Occasion</b><br>
    People sometimes do not bring their water, which is incredibly unhealthy<br>
    <b>Audience</b><br>
    Anyone in band, especially those who often do not bring water<br>
    <b>Purpose</b><br>
    To encourage band members to bring their water.<br>
    <b>Subject</b><br>
    Hydration, specifically from water in band<br>
    <b><u>Strategies</u></b><br>
    <b>Appeal to fear</b><br>
    Most people do not like being extremely sweaty/dead, the propaganda says that if they do not bring water, they will
    end up sweaty/dead.<br>
    <b>Post Hoc</b><br>
    Most people do not like being extremely sweaty/dead, the propaganda says that if they do not bring water, they will end up sweaty/dead.<br>
    <b>Exaggeration/Occlusion of fact</b><br>
    The propaganda implies that only people without water will sweat, while in reality, most everyone will sweat if they are outside exercising.<br>

    <b>False dilemma</b><br>
    While in general neglecting to bring water to practice is not good, there are more possible states than hydrated and dead.<br>
