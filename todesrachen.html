    <br>
    <b>Speaker</b><br>
    Anti-war organization/group.<br>
    <b>Occasion</b><br>
    Germany was fighting in WWI<br>
    <b>Audience</b><br>
    People who have not enlisted in WWI<br>
    <b>Purpose</b><br>
    To discourage the reader from enlisting in the army<br>
    <b>Subject</b><br>
    The death seen from fighting/war.<br>
    <b><u>Strategies</u></b><br>
    <b>Appeal to fear</b><br>
    The soldiers are jumping into the skeleton’s mouth and coming out dead. This is meant to discourage people from
    joining the war.<br>
    The man in white is holding a whip to whip the soldiers into the skeleton. This implies that those jumping into the
    skeleton’s mouth are being forced into doing such.<br>
    <b>Post Hoc</b><br>
    The soldiers dying after jumping into the skeleton’s mouth directly implies that going to war results only in death.<br>
    <b>Ad Hominem</b><br>
    While I cannot find evidence that the two large men are specific people, they are clearly caricatures of at least
    the aristocratic enlisting people into the war. The man in black is holding pieces of paper saying “war profits” and
    company shares.<br>

    <b>Appeal to fear</b><br>
    The text says that today it is the reader’s turn (to die) and tomorrow will be the author’s.<br>
    <b>Loaded terms</b><br>
    “Todesrachen” can be translated as “the jaws of death”. Alternatively, it can be translated as “the dragon of
    death”. These both invoke negative feelings in the reader.<br>
